I wish that we could skip to the part when we was married up,
Skip the walks in the park I wanna carry ya
Back to our own place don't wanna waste another day
Already know what you mean to me

I like the things you like
You like the things I like yeah
So don't hesitate tonight
I like the things you like
You like the things I do
So come on and come on and let's go

Fast forward into the future
Cause I could spend forever with you
Fast forward into our destiny
Cause there's so many things we could do
If you push my buttons we can go to the next scene
If you push my buttons we can go to the next scene
If you push my buttons we can go to the next scene
If you push my buttons F.F.W.D

Sometimes it gets kinda hard to see the future
But I don't think we could fall any deeper
I'm gonna tell you once I'm gonna tell
you twice don't let this slip away
So baby press my green button and make tomorrow today

I like the things you like
You like the things I like yeah
So don't hesitate tonight
I like the things you like
You like the things I do
So come on and come on and let's go

Fast Forward into the future
Cause I could spend forever with you
Fast forward into our destiny
Cause there's so many things we could do
If you push my buttons we can go to the next scene
If you push my buttons we can go to the next scene
If you push my buttons we can go to the next scene
If you push my buttons F.F.W.D

If you push my buttons
If you push my buttons (oh right)
If you push my buttons
If you push my buttons F.F.W.D

Fast forward into the future
Cause I could spend forever with you
Fast forward into our destiny
Cause there's so many things we could do
If you push my buttons we can go to the next scene
If you push my buttons we can go to the next scene
If you push my buttons we can go to the next scene
If you push my buttons F.F.W.D

If you push my buttons we can go to the next scene
If you push my buttons we can go to the next scene
If you push my buttons we can go to the next scene
If you push my buttons F.F.W.D
